# Project: Build a Portfolio Site

This is the second project of the Udacity's Full Stack Web Developers Nanodegree.

The project consists in building a portfolio website, based on a design mockup ([PDF-file](mockup/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf)). The website replicates the design in HTML, CSS, and is a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the projects that will be developed during the Nanodegree program.

This project followed the [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/).
